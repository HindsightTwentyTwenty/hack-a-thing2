#Starring Webpages: Chrome extension

We developed a chrome extension that allows the user to save the page that they are currently viewing.
Upon click of the extension icon, users view a list of saved urls as well as the option to save the current page.

Through this project, we learned how the various components of a chrome extension fit together, how to create a popup related to a chrome extension, how to pass messages between background and content scripts, and how to use chrome storage.
